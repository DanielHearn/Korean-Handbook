           | Welcome to The Korean Handbook where you will get to learn the basic Korean language known as Hangul or 
           span.content__korean 한굴
           | . This website is developed and maintained by 
           a.content__link(href="http://danielhearn.co.uk") Daniel Hearn
           |  but is open source on 
           a.content__link(href="https://github.com/DanielHearn/Korean-Handbook") Github
           |  if you would like to contribute content (I would especially appreciate audio).
          p.content__text But enough with the introduction, lets get started!

        section.hangul__content
          p.content__text 
            | The Korean alphabet is actually very easy to learn compared to alphabets from other languages such as Chinese and Japanese.
            | As Korean as it requires little memorisation, the following sections will teach you the Hangul and romanized versions of the 
            | consonants, vowels as well as the basic combinations and the additional outlier combinations. Once you understand Hangul you 
            | should then avoid looking at romanized versions of words, the romanizations used below aim to be the best representations using
            | English but you should instead use audio of the words and practice with them to ensure accurate pronunciation. 
          section.content__blocks
            h4.content__title Blocks
            p.content__text 
              | Korean is made up of blocks that each contain a syllable but can be drawn in different ways as summarised below.
              | The first element is a consonant which can also be pronounced silently or be a double consonant as you will learn further on. Next
              | will be either one or two vowels below or to the right of the block, finally sometimes there will be a final consonant at the bottom
              | of the block.

            p.content__text
              | Below are all of the basic Korean consonants, most of which are very straightforward as most are unique with the only ㅈ(j) and
              | ㅊ(ch) being similar. In terms of their pronunciation only ㄹ is difficult 
              | as it sounds like a mix between r and l, and may require time to get used to.
            p.content__text
             | Another part that will require remembering is that ㅇ(ng) will be silent and not pronounced if placed in the initial
             | position of a block and required if vowel is being placed at the front of a block/syllable, otherwise it is pronounced normally.
             | For example 엄마 is pronounced eomma with the ㅇ(ng) being silent, while 강 is pronounced kang as ㅇ is in the final position.
            ul.content__koreanlist

            h4.content__title Doubled Consonants
            p.content__text
              | The consonants can also be doubled causing their sound to be pronounced stronger.
            ul.content__koreanlist

            h4.content__title Vowels
            p.content__text
              | Next are the vowels, as you will notice the vowels are seperated into vertical and horizontal alignments, with vowels that use 
              | vertical lines being placed to the right of the block vertically, while the vowels with horizontal line then being placed horizontally.
            ul.content__koreanlist

            h4.content__title Vowel Combinations
            p.content__text
              | While most blocks/syllables will be pronounced according to the placement of their elements their are other combinations mainly
              | focused on the pronunciation of w sounds.
            ul.content__koreanlist

          section.content__outliers#rules
            h4.content__title Additional Rules or Outliers
            p.content__text
              | Additionally there are additional rules or outliers to the language as summarised below.
            p.content__text
              | ㅇ(ng) will be silent and not pronounced if placed in the initial
              | position of a block and required if vowel is being placed at the front of a block/syllable, otherwise it is pronounced normally.
              | For example 엄마 is pronounced eomma with the ㅇ(ng) being silent, while 강 is pronounced kang as ㅇ is in the final position.
            p.content__text
              | There are also some consonants that if placed in the final position within a block will be pronounced with ㅌ(t) sound, these 
              | characters are ㄷ, ㅅ, ㅆ, ㅈ, ㅊ, and ㅌ. For example 맛 is pronounced as mat, 꽃 pronounced as got, and 있다 pronounced as itda.
