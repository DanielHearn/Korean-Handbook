This website is developed and maintained by <a class="content__link" href="http://danielhearn.co.uk">Daniel Hearn</a> but is open source on <a class="content__link" href="https://github.com/DanielHearn/Korean-Handbook">Github</a> if you would like to contribute content (I would especially appreciate audio).</p><p class="content__text">But enough with the introduction, lets get started!</p></section></section><section class="hangul" id="hangul"><h3 class="hangul__title">Hangul</h3><section class="hangul__content"><p class="content__text"> The Korean alphabet is actually very easy to learn compared to alphabets from other languages such as Chinese and Japanese.
As Korean as it requires little memorisation, the following sections will teach you the Hangul and romanized versions of the 
consonants, vowels as well as the basic combinations and the additional outlier combinations. Once you understand Hangul you 
should then avoid looking at romanized versions of words, the romanizations used below aim to be the best representations using
English but you should instead use audio of the words and practice with them to ensure accurate pronunciation. </p><section class="content__blocks"><h4 class="content__title">Blocks</h4><p class="content__text"> Korean is made up of blocks that each contain a syllable but can be drawn in different ways as summarised below.
The first element is a consonant which can also be pronounced silently or be a double consonant as you will learn further on. Next
will be either one or two vowels below or to the right of the block, finally sometimes there will be a final consonant at the bottom
of the block.</p><ul class="content__blocklist"><li class="blocklist__item--12vertical"><div>1 </div><div>2</div></li><li class="blocklist__item--123vertical"><div>1 </div><div>2</div><div>3</div></li><li class="blocklist__item--12horizontal"><div>1 </div><div>2</div></li><li class="blocklist__item--123horizontal"><div>1 </div><div>2</div><div>3</div></li></ul></section><section class="content__consonants"><h4 class="content__title">Consonants</h4><p class="content__text">Below are all of the basic Korean consonants, most of which are very straightforward as most are unique with the only ㅈ(j) and
ㅊ(ch) being similar. In terms of their pronunciation only ㄹ is difficult 
as it sounds like a mix between r and l, and may require time to get used to.</p><p class="content__text">Another part that will require remembering is that ㅇ(ng) will be silent and not pronounced if placed in the initial
position of a block and required if vowel is being placed at the front of a block/syllable, otherwise it is pronounced normally.
For example 엄마 is pronounced eomma with the ㅇ(ng) being silent, while 강 is pronounced kang as ㅇ is in the final position.</p><ul class="content__koreanlist"><li class="koreanlist__item" v-for="consonant in consonants"><p class="item__korean">{{consonant.korean}}</p><p class="item__pronunciation">{{consonant.pronunciation}}</p></li></ul></section><section class="content__doubles"><h4 class="content__title">Doubled Consonants</h4><p class="content__text">The consonants can also be doubled causing their sound to be pronounced stronger.</p><ul class="content__koreanlist"><li class="koreanlist__item" v-for="double in doubles"><p class="item__korean">{{double.korean}}</p><p class="item__pronunciation">{{double.pronunciation}}</p></li></ul></section><section class="content__vowels"><h4 class="content__title">Vowels</h4><p class="content__text">Next are the vowels, as you will notice the vowels are seperated into vertical and horizontal alignments, with vowels that use 
vertical lines being placed to the right of the block vertically, while the vowels with horizontal line then being placed horizontally.</p><ul class="content__koreanlist"><li class="koreanlist__item" v-for="vowel in vowels"><p class="item__korean">{{vowel.korean}}</p><p class="item__pronunciation">{{vowel.pronunciation}}</p></li></ul></section><section class="content__combinations"><h4 class="content__title">Vowel Combinations</h4><p class="content__text">While most blocks/syllables will be pronounced according to the placement of their elements their are other combinations mainly
focused on the pronunciation of w sounds.</p><ul class="content__koreanlist"><li class="koreanlist__item" v-for="combination in combinations"><p class="item__korean">{{combination.korean}}</p><p class="item__pronunciation">{{combination.pronunciation}}</p></li></ul></section><section class="content__outliers" id="rules"><h4 class="content__title">Additional Rules or Outliers</h4><p class="content__text">Additionally there are additional rules or outliers to the language as summarised below.</p><p class="content__text">ㅇ(ng) will be silent and not pronounced if placed in the initial
position of a block and required if vowel is being placed at the front of a block/syllable, otherwise it is pronounced normally.
For example 엄마 is pronounced eomma with the ㅇ(ng) being silent, while 강 is pronounced kang as ㅇ is in the final position.</p><p class="content__text">There are also some consonants that if placed in the final position within a block will be pronounced with ㅌ(t) sound, these 
characters are ㄷ, ㅅ, ㅆ, ㅈ, ㅊ, and ㅌ. For example 맛 is pronounced as mat, 꽃 pronounced as got, and 있다 pronounced as itda.</p></section></section></section></main></body></html>
