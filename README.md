### TODO
- Finish v1 implementation with all basic content.
- Get audio for all characters and basic words, and let them be played when the character is clicked.

### Contributions

Contributions are welcome for corrections, new ideas on helping to teach the language (interesting visual ideas would be nice), and audio for each character and the basic words.
