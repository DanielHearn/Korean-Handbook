Korean language, starting with the alphabet known as Hangul or in Korean as <span class="k">한굴</span>
. This website is developed and maintained by <a class="content__link" href="http://danielhearn.co.uk">Daniel Hearn</a> feel free to <a class="content__link" href="mailto:korean@danielhearn.co.uk">email me</a>, but is open source on <a class="content__link" href="https://github.com/DanielHearn/Korean-Handbook">Github</a> if you would like to contribute content (I would especially appreciate audio).</p><p class="content__text">I also developed a random korean word generator available <a class="content__link" href="../random.html">here</a>.</p><p class="content__text">But enough with the introduction, lets get started!</p></section></section><section class="content" id="intro"><h3 class="content__title">Intro to Hangul</h3><section class="hangul__content"><p class="content__text"> The Korean alphabet or Hangul (<span class="k">한굴</span>
) is actually easy to learn when compared to alphabets from other languages such as Chinese and Japanese.
This is due to Korean requiring considerably less memorisation, the following sections will teach you the Hangul and romanized versions of the 
consonants, vowels, basic combinations and basic language rules. Once you understand Hangul you 
should then avoid looking at romanized versions of words, the romanizations used below aim to be the best representations using
English but you should use audio of the characters and words ensure accurate pronunciation. </p><p class="content__text"> The Korean language was originally written using Chinese characters known as Hanja but is now written using Hangul which was 
was introduced and official published in 1446 by King Sejong.</p><p class="content__text"> Korean contains consonants and vowels assembled into blocks which are similar to syllables. Basic words include <span class="k">안녕하세요</span>
(hello) pronounced as an-nyeong-ha-se-yo, <span class="k">년</span> (year) pronounced as nyeon, and <span class="k">날씨</span>
(weather) pronounced as nal-ssi. </p></section></section><section class="content"><h3 class="content__title">Loan words and Konglish</h3><section class="hangul__content"><p class="content__text"> There are also loan words from English such as <span class="k">메뉴</span> 
which is both pronounced and written as menyu (menu), or <span class="k">주스</span> 
also pronounced and written as juseu (juice). As well there are also the commonly misunderstood Konglish words which are often confused 
with the loan words. This term is used for words that use English words but have a different meaning in Korean such as <span class="k">개그맨</span> 
or gag man which means comedian in Korean.</p></section></section><section class="content"><h4 class="content__title">Blocks</h4><p class="content__text"> Korean is made up of blocks which also act as syllables, these are made up of the individual korean characters known as <span class="k">자모</span> 
(pronounced as jamo) . These blocks can be constructed in different ways as summarised below.
The first element is always a consonant which can also be pronounced silently if it is a 
<span class="k">ㅇ</span> (ng) as you will learn within the rules later on. Next
will be either one or two vowels below or to the right inside of the block, finally sometimes there will be a final consonant at the bottom
of the block.</p><p class="content__text"> Most blocks will contain 2 to 3 characters either horizontally and vertically, but as well there are a few very unique outlier words with 
4 or 5 characters in their blocks such as <span class="k">닭</span> (chicken).</p><ul class="content__blocklist"><li class="blocklist__item"><div class="blocklist__item--12vertical"><div>1 </div><div>2</div></div><p class="item__korean--blocks">무</p></li><li class="blocklist__item"><div class="blocklist__item--123vertical"><div>1 </div><div>2</div><div>3</div></div><p class="item__korean--blocks">극</p></li><li class="blocklist__item"><div class="blocklist__item--12horizontal"><div>1 </div><div>2</div></div><p class="item__korean--blocks">가</p></li><li class="blocklist__item"><div class="blocklist__item--123horizontal"><div>1 </div><div>2</div><div>3</div></div><p class="item__korean--blocks">긱</p><li class="blocklist__item"><div class="blocklist__item--123horizontal"><div>1 </div><div>2</div><div>3</div><div>4</div></div><p class="item__korean--blocks">닭</p></li></li></ul></section><section class="content" id="consonants"><h4 class="content__title">Consonants</h4><p class="content__text">Below are all of the Korean consonants, most of which are very straightforward due to their uniqueness
with the only <span class="k">ㅈ</span> (j) and <span class="k">ㅊ</span> (ch) being similar in shape depending on the font style 
being used. In terms of their pronunciation only <span class="k">ㄹ</span> is should require more practice as it 
sounds like a mix between r and l, and may require time to get used to.</p><ul class="klist"><li class="koreanlist__item" v-for="consonant in consonants"><p class="item__korean">{{consonant.korean}}</p><p class="item__pronunciation">{{consonant.pronunciation}}</p></li></ul></section><section class="content"><h4 class="content__title">Doubled Consonants</h4><p class="content__text">The consonants can also be doubled up causing their sound to be pronounced stronger.</p><ul class="klist"><li class="koreanlist__item" v-for="double in doubles"><p class="item__korean">{{double.korean}}</p><p class="item__pronunciation">{{double.pronunciation}}</p></li></ul></section><section class="content" id="vowels"><h4 class="content__title">Vowels</h4><p class="content__text">Next are the vowels, these are seperated into vertical and horizontal alignments, with vowels being aligned 
based on the orientation of the main line of the vowel. These characters should be easy to learn as most
have mirrored and doubled versions for the y characters.</p><ul class="klist"><li class="koreanlist__item" v-for="vowel in vowels"><p class="item__korean">{{vowel.korean}}</p><p class="item__pronunciation">{{vowel.pronunciation}}</p></li></ul></section><section class="content"><h4 class="content__title">Vowel Combinations</h4><p class="content__text">While most blocks will be pronounced according to the placement of their characters, their are other combinations mainly
focused on the pronunciation of w sounds.</p><ul class="klist"><li class="koreanlist__item" v-for="combination in combinations"><p class="item__korean">{{combination.korean}}</p><p class="item__pronunciation">{{combination.pronunciation}}</p></li></ul></section><section class="content" id="rules"><h4 class="content__title">Basic Language Rules</h4><p class="content__text">Additionally there are rules or outliers to the korean language, the basics of these rules are summarised below.</p><p class="content__text"><strong>ㅇ - Ieung Block Placement</strong></p><p class="content__text">The character <span class="k">ㅇ</span> (ng) will be pronounced differently depending on its location within the block, which are
described in the next few lines.</p><p class="content__text">The <span class="k">ㅇ</span> character is silent and not pronounced if placed as the initial character in a block. For example 
<span class="k">엄마</span> is pronounced eomma with the <span class="k">ㅇ</span> (ng) being silent.</p><p class="content__text">If the <span class="k">ㅇ</span> is positioned somewhere in the middle of a word there are two possibilities as shown below:<ol> <li>If <span class="k">ㅇ</span> follows a consonant the <span class="k">ㅇ</span> replaces the preceding consonant, for example 
<span class="k">한국어</span> is instead pronounced as <span class="k">한구거</span>  </li><li>If <span class="k">ㅇ</span> is not preceded by a consonant the character is silent.</li></ol><p class="content__text">If  <span class="k">ㅇ</span> is in the final position it is pronounced with an ng sound, for example 
<span class="k">강</span> is pronounced as kang.</p></p><p class="content__text"><strong>T-Stops</strong></p><p class="content__text">There are also some consonants that if placed in the final position within a block will be pronounced with the
<span class="k">ㅌ</span> (t) sound, these characters are <span class="k">ㄷ</span> , <span class="k">ㅅ</span> , <span class="k">ㅆ</span> , <span class="k">ㅈ</span> , <span class="k">ㅊ</span>.
For example <span class="k">맛</span> is pronounced as mat, <span class="k">꽃</span> pronounced as got, and <span class="k">있다</span> pronounced as itda.</p></section><section class="content" id="words"><h4 class="content__title">Basic Words</h4><p class="content__text">Next use the consonants and vowels you just learnt and try reading various beginner words and phrases with just hangul and without romanizations.</p><p class="content__text">You can also test your new knowledge on my random korean word generator available <a class="content__link" href="../random.html">here.</a></p><ul class="content__wordList"><li class="wordList__word" v-for="word in words"><p class="k--wordList">{{ word.word }}</p><p class="content__text">{{ word.meaning }}</p></li></ul></section><section class="content"><h4 class="content__title">Next Steps</h4><p class="content__text">Now that you understand the very basics of the Korean language you can start to learn words, sentence structure, grammar and really
