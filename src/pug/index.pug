             | Welcome to The Korean Handbook where you will get to learn the basic Korean language known as Hangul or

             | . This website is developed and maintained by

              | The Korean alphabet is actually easy to learn when compared to alphabets from other languages such as Chinese and Japanese.
              | As Korean requires considerably less memorisation, the following sections will teach you the Hangul and romanized versions of the 
              | consonants, vowels as well as the basic combinations and the additional rules. Once you understand Hangul you 
              | should then avoid looking at romanized versions of words, the romanizations used below aim to be the best representations using
              | English but you should use audio of the characters and words ensure accurate pronunciation.

          h4.content__title Blocks
          p.content__text 
            | Korean is made up of blocks which also act as syllables, these are made up of the individual characters. These blocks
            | can be constructed in different ways as summarised below.
            | The first element is always a consonant which can also be pronounced silently or be a double consonant as you will learn further on. Next
            | will be either one or two vowels below or to the right inside of the block, finally sometimes there will be a final consonant at the bottom
            | of the block.

            | Below are all of the Korean consonants, most of which are very straightforward due to their uniqueness with the only ㅈ(j) and
            | ㅊ(ch) being similar. In terms of their pronunciation only ㄹ is should require more practice
            | as it sounds like a mix between r and l, and may require time to get used to.

            | based on the orientation of the main line of the vowel.

          p.content__text
            | Additionally there are additional rules or outliers to the language as summarised below.
          p.content__text
            | ㅇ(ng) will be silent and not pronounced if placed in the initial
            | position of a block and required if vowel is being placed at the front of a block/syllable, otherwise it is pronounced normally.
            | For example 엄마 is pronounced eomma with the ㅇ(ng) being silent, while 강 is pronounced kang as ㅇ is in the final position.
          p.content__text
            | There are also some consonants that if placed in the final position within a block will be pronounced with ㅌ(t) sound, these 
            | characters are ㄷ, ㅅ, ㅆ, ㅈ, ㅊ, and ㅌ. For example 맛 is pronounced as mat, 꽃 pronounced as got, and 있다 pronounced as itda.
